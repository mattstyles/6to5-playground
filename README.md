> 6to5 transpiled build


## Getting Started

Once cloned and installed there is a handy start script to get transpiling, this also sets up a watch task if you just want to crack on and get hacking.

```
npm install
bower install
npm run start
```

Then use a file server to serve `index.html` and youâ€™re all good.
